# web3reporter
An onchain tool where you can report scam blockchain addresses.

### How it works:
BSC Testnet Contract holds report data, so essentially users can write to the BSC Testnet a report for any address, and the contract holds all of the reports.
We use BSC Testnet as it is a convenient way to write on-chain without any fees or costs.

### Future / Roadmap:
- Clientside data analysis of reports.
  - Analyze reporters and their on-chain history.
  - Create a "score" using analysis.

- Review Address as Safe
- Display reports and their messages, and Upvote/Downvote reports.
